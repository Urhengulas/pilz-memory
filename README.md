# Pilz memory

This is a version of memory for learning the names and characteristics of mushrooms. It is based on the pairs principle: pairs of matching, face-down cards must be recognised by the players by turning them face up.

Initially its gonna be a single player version. The player sees a grid of 16 face-down cards. They can uncover two of them by clicking on them. If they are matching they get removed from the grid. If they are not matching the get covered again. The game counts the rounds until all pais are found.

For the beginning its gonna be identical cards that have to be found. Then it should be matching cards with the same mushroom, but not identical. Maybe one has the name and the other the picture. Or it is two pictures of the same mushroom but not the same picture.

For a multiplayer version (in front of one computer still) the players can set the number of players and then uncover the cards in turns. If a player finds a matching pair they get another turn. Otherwise the next player's turn. But that is Zukunftsmusik.
